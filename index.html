<p>I have one project on GitHub: <a href="http://kien-kieu.github.io/lite/">LiTe</a> which is a C++ library devoted to the simulation of random tessellations (aka mosaics). LiTe main features are also available to R users through an R package.</p>
<p>I am a statistician working at INRA in France. To know more about me, have a look on my INRA personal <a href="http://maiage.jouy.inra.fr/?q=fr/kienkieu">Web page</a> (only in French at the moment, sorry).</p>
